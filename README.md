### -Classification-of-Surface-Crack-and-Its-Severity-using-CNN

# Overview:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting surface cracks on house walls. The model is trained to classify cracks into three categories: severe, moderate, and mild. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains labeled images of surfaces with different crack severities.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of various surfaces with surface cracks. Each image is labeled with one of the three crack severity categories: severe, moderate, or mild. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for model training, tuning, and evaluation.

# Model Architecture

The crack detection model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The CNN is designed to learn features from the images and classify them into one of the three crack severity categories.
